 an on device database for word lookup.  The online database is no

 card if it is installed.  If you do not have an SD memory card
 installed, the database will be installed in your device's memory.</p>

 with word scores turned off.</p>

 selecting the notification.  To get rid of the icon, select <b>Exit</b> from the
 <b>MENU</b> button when in the app.</p>

<p>Fixed crashes caused by the app trying to open a dialog box from a window that

 will now show the letter being used as the wildcard in <b>GREEN</b> for each
 word.</p>

<p>Added <b>CLEAR</b> buttons to all text entry fields for quick clearing of
 the control.</p>

<p>The current contents of all text entry fields are saved to the device so if
 the app is exited or shutdown by Android, when restarted all text entry fields
 will be restored to their last state.</p>

<p>Removed a check for <b>Airplane Mode</b> that wasn't necessary.</p>

<h4>Version 3.0b</h4>

 more than 22,000 words.</p>

<p>Fixed other force close issues.</p>

<h4>Version 3.0a</h4>

<p>Fixed search results so that in case the device is reoriented (from landscape
 to portrait or vice-versa) the board letter highlighting provided by the <b>Anagrams</b>
 tab is preserved.</p>

<p>Fixed crash caused by not providing a list of board letters.</p>

<p>Fixed crash in <b>Word Judge</b> when only one letter is entered.  More than
 one letter is now required in this tab's search box.</p>

 character would cause a crash of the application.</p>

<h4>Version 3.0</h4>

<p>First version with a <b>PAID</b> and <b>FREE</b> version.  Free version
 contains ads on all of the tabs, the search results, and search history.  Paid
 version has no ads and adds the <b>Dictionary</b> and <b>Crosswords</b> tabs.</p>

<p><b>PAID VERSION ONLY</b>: Added ability to move the Scrabble(TM) dictionaries
 into a database that is resident on the device in either device storage or,
 if one is installed, an SD memory card.  If an SD memory card is installed,
 the database will always be installed there.  The user has the ability to switch
 between either the online or device resident dictionaries at any time.  When
 switching to the online dictionaries, the device resident database will be removed.
 Each tab that uses the Scrabble(TM) dictionaries has a menu item for switching the
 dictionary database location.</p>

<p>Changed the <b>Anagram</b> tab to have two text entries; one for tray letters
 and one for board letters.  The search results now show the board letters highlighted
 in red text to help players fit words on the Scrabble(TM) playboard.</p>

<p>Cleaned-up search history code necessitating the creation of V3
 history data.  All prior history is removed when v3.0 is started the
 first time.</p>

<p>When sorting search results alphabetically, results are indexed by
 the first letter of the word.  The scroll bar will present the user
 with the current index being viewed.</p>

<p>Fixed crash caused by hitting the <b>Search</b> button without
 any search string entered.  Applies to all tabs.</b>

<p>Fixed progress dialogs when searching so that hitting <b>Cancel</b>
 will cause the search to be properly terminated and the user to be
 returned to the main screen.</b>

<h4>Version 2.2</h4>

<p>Added <b>Cancel</b> button to dialog boxes displayed while performing
 searches.  Changed the way retries for communication errors are processed so
 that the program will continue to retry under certain conditions.  If the user
 is having some sort of network problem with their cellular carrier, they may
 now click the <b>Cancel</b> button to terminate the search or keep waiting
 until the network problem resolves itself.</p>

<p>Turned off spell-checking for all text entry.</p>

<p>Added a note to the user for when they are connected to a WiFi hotspot
 but not authorized to use the hotspot.  In these cases, the program dutifully
 reported an unspecified error as the returned data made no sense.  It
 now will report an error but explain to the user that they need to check
 their WiFi connection before continuing.  The error may still be reported to
 PPP.</p>
 
<p>Selecting an item out of the history list to repeat a search now works as
 it should.  History will be reloaded correctly.  <b>NOTE:</b> This fix requires
 that your current history be erased.</p>

<h4>Version 2.1a</h4>

<p>Added retry handling for certain types of errors related to networking (unknown hosts,
 disconnected during communication with server, unable to connect to server, bad
 HTTP responses).  If any of these conditions occur more than 5 times during a
 single request, an error will be displayed and the user will be allowed to report
 it to PPP.</p>

<p>Fixed input character handler for <b>Word Judge</b> so that consecutive commas
 can no longer be entered.</p>

<h4>Version 2.1</h4>

<p>Fixed application crashes when changing screen orientation.</p>

<p>Enhanced <b>Word Judge</b> so that multiple words can be entered by separating them
 with a comma (<b>,</b>).</p>

<p>Added the ability to sort dictionary and anagram searches by word length.</p>

<p>Eliminated unused anagram generation for DICT.ORG dictionaries.  Any historic searches
 of this sort are changed to do anagram lookup on SOWPODS.</p>
 
<p>Eliminated GCIDE and Webster's 1913 dictionaries as user-selectable dictionaries in
 the <b>Dictionary</b> tab and instead replaced these with <b>All DICT.ORG Dictionaries</b>.
 This allows users the ability to search <b>ALL</b> on-line dictionaries provided by
 DICT.ORG, returning many more definitions.  This resolves some of the missing definitions
 found when using the on-line thesaurus.  <b>NOTE:</b> This change requires the
 search history to be cleared automatically when this version is installed and first
 run.</p>

<h4>Version 2.0</h4>

<p>Added <b>Word Judge</b> tab that takes a word and displays whether or not the word is
 in the user selected Scrabble(TM) word list.</p>
 
<p>Consolidated <b>Thesaurus</b> tab in <b>Dictionary</b> tab as a separate user-selectable
 dictionary.</p>
 
<p>Fixed problem in <b>Anagram</b> input where it was possible to cause an application
 failure because the input string was only a single character or longer than 20
 characters.</p>
 
<p>Fixed problem in the <b>Dictionary</b> tab where it was possible when in landscape
 mode that the toggle buttons for scoring and sorting would be outside the view.
 Changed so the buttons are now centered on a single line of the layout and the
 sorting button is disabled when scoring is disabled.</p>
 
<h4>Version 1.2a</h4>

<p>Inadvertently removed support for Android v1.5 in last release.  Put this support back
 into the app.</p>

<p>Added support for saving the current state of the toggle buttons for scoring and sorting
 in the <b>Dictionary</b> and <b>Anagrams</b> tabs so they are restored when the app is first
  executed.</p>

<p>Implemented the ability to email problem reports detected at runtime to the development
 staff.</p>

<p>Implemented the ability to reach PPP website by clicking the app icon in the <b>About</b>
 dialog.</p>

<h4>Version 1.2</h4>

<p>Implemented five well-known Scrabble(TM) word lists and added the use of these word
 lists to the <b>Dictionary</b> and <b>Anagrams</b> tabs.  The user's selection of each of these
 dictionaries is saved to device memory so that they are restored when the application is
 started.</p>

<p><b>Dictionary</b> and <b>Anagrams</b> lookups when using a Scrabble(TM) word list
 can provide scoring in returned word lists.  Word lists in these cases can be sorted by score
 (high to low) or alphabetically.</b>

<p>New icons!</b>

<p>Implemented a WebView activity for displaying help and release notes.</p>

<p>Eliminated the <b>Quick Scramble</b> and <b>Full Scramble</b> options in the <b>Anagrams</b>
 tab.</p>

<p>Regular dictionary anagram lookup now does a complete anagram search by using a Power Set.</p>

<p>Added an icon to inform users that the dictionary backend is provided by dict.org.</p>

<h4>Version 1.1</h4>

<p>Anagrams search now faster.</p>

<p>Added Quick Scramble mode to <b>Anagrams</b> where one character on the end of the word is
 removed for each iteration.</p>

<p>Added Full Scramble mode to <b>Anagrams</b> which searches all possible anagrams.</p>

<p>Can now use a period (<b>.</b>) for patterns in crosswords.</p>

<p>Added <b>Release Notes</b> to <b>About</b> dialog.</p>

<p>Added <b>Contact Us!</b> to <b>About</b> dialog.</p>

<p>Fixed exception caused by email not being configured when using <b>Email</b> context menu
 option.</p>

<h4>Version 1.0</h4>

<p>Initial release.</p>
