<h3>Anagrams</h3>

<p>In anagrams mode, enter the letters in your tray in the top search box and zero or
 more letters from the Scrabble(TM) board in the bottom search box to find all of the
 valid words that can be made from all combinations of the combined letters.  Selecting
 a word from the returned list will display the definitions of that word.  The letters
 entered in the bottom search box will be highlighted in red in the search results
 to help you better place words on the play board.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Some words in Scrabble(TM) word lists may not have definitions in the
 online dictionary.</p>

<p>To select a dictionary, select <b>Dictionaries</b> from the main menu.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The dictionary selection for this tab is independent from the dictionary
 selected in the <b>Dictionary</b> or <b>Word Judge</b> tabs.</p>

<p>You may specify <b>ONE</b> wildcard character using either a period (<b>.</b>) or a
 question mark (<b>?</b>).</p>

<h4>Sorting and Scoring</h4>

<p>You may have word scores computed and displayed.  You may also sort the resulting word
 lists by score (only if scoring is enabled), word length, or alphabetically.  Use the buttons
 underneath the search text box to set these options.</b>
