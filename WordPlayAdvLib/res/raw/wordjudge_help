<h3>Word Judge</h3>

<p>In <b>Word Judge</b> mode, you can quickly determine if a word is in the current Scrabble(TM)
 word list by simply entering the word in the search box and clicking the <b>Judge</b>
 button.</p>
 
<p>You may also enter a list of words separated by commas (<b>,</b>) to determine if all of
 the words in the list are in the current Scrabble(TM) word list.  Use this feature
 when playing to determine if a play (rather than an individual word) is valid.</p>

<p>To select a dictionary, select <b>Dictionaries</b> from the main menu.</p>

<p>After clicking the <b>Judge</b> button, the result of your search will be displayed in a
 list underneath the search box.  The most recent search result will be displayed at the top of
 the list.</p>
 
<p>Items in the list can themselves be clicked.  Clicking a word that was found in a Scrabble(TM)
 word list will show the definitions for that word.</p>
  
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Some words in a Scrabble(TM) word list may not have definitions in
 the online regular dictionary.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The dictionary selection for this tab is independent from the dictionary selected
 in the <b>Dictionary</b> or <b>Anagrams</b> tabs.</p>
