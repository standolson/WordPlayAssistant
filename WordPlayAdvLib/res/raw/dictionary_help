<h3>Dictionary</h3>

<p>In dictionary mode, enter a word in the search box and click the Search button.</p>

<p>To select a dictionary, select <b>Dictionaries</b> from the main menu.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The dictionary selection for this tab is independent from the dictionary
 selected in the other tabs.</p>

<p>When using the DICT.ORG dictionaries, if a word in the dictionary exactly matches the text
 entered, a list of dictionary definitions will be displayed.  Selecting one of these entries
 will display the entire dictionary entry.</p>

<p>If more than one word in the dictionary matches the text entered using a non-exact match,
 a list of words will be displayed.  Selecting one of these words will display all of the
 definitions of that word.</p>

<p>When using a Scrabble(TM) word list, only a word list will be returned.  Selecting
 a word from the list will display the definitions of the word.</p>
 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Some words in a Scrabble(TM) word list may not have definitions in
 the online regular dictionary.</p>

 underneath the search text box to set these options.</b>
